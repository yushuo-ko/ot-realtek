# OpenThread on Realtek RTL8777G Example

This repo contains example platform drivers for the [Realtek RTL8777G][RTL8777G].

[RTL8777G]: https://www.realtek.com/

## Download submodule
In a Bash terminal, follow these instructions to clone all submodules.

```bash
$ cd <path-to-ot-realtek>
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Building

In a Bash terminal, follow these instructions to build the RTL8777G examples.

```bash
$ cd <path-to-ot-realtek>
$ OT_CMAKE_NINJA_TARGET="ot-cli-ftd" ./script/build rtl87x2g sdk rtl8777g
```

## Flash Binaries

If the build completed successfully, the `bin` files may be found in `<path-to-realtek>/build/bin/`.

To flash the images with [MPCli tool][MPCli], we should copy image file to MPCli tool file.

[MPCLi]: https://github.com/rtkconnectivity/ot-realtek/tree/main/third_party/Realtek/tool/mpcli

```bash
$ cd <path-to-ot-realtek>
$ cp ./build/bin/<ot-cli-ftd_MP_dev_0.0.0.0_XXXX.bin> ./third_party/Realtek/tool/mpcli/bin
```

Then we should modify mptool config file.

```bash
$ vim ./third_party/Realtek/tool/mpcli/mptoolconfig.json
```

Replace <ot-cli-ftd.bin> with image file name.

Program file with MPCli.
```bash
$ cd ./third_party/Realtek/tool/mpcli
$ sudo mpcli -f mptoolconfig.json -c <serial port> -a -r
```
Example: ```sudo mpcli -f mptoolconfig.json -c /dev/ttyUSB0 -a -r```
